# **Welcome to my blog.**

I am **Vivek** and I build stuff. 

Primarily a software engineer interested in web, linux, system design
and machine learning. Here I'll be documenting my software development journey along with a myraid of other 
things which I'm deeply interested in.

If you find my work interesting, do feel free to contact me on one of my social media platforms.
I'm most active on my twitter.
