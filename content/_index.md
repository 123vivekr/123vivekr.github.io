# Creativity is not a talent. It's a way of operating.

Things seem to be in place only when you look back on them, as Steeve Jobs explained.

It's the act of consistently trying out stuff and failing, that ultimately leads to fuitful learning
and satisfaction, speaking from experience.

This blog is just that- an experiment, a trial of sorts, to document, to express and to exhibit the learnings and 
experiences along my journey. Feel free to go though them and leave feedback, you are most welcome.
