      <description>It was for a project during my undergrad that I grew interest for this strange programming language. It was suggested by none other than my team mate, and hardcore Rustacean Devdutt.
Rust is different from the languages I&amp;rsquo;ve been used to, like Python and JavaScript. I have tried my hands at static typed low level languages like C and C++ and in my opinion, they are easy to get started with.</description>

      <description>This post is a summary of the work that has been completed during the GSoC 2020 period for my project, Object Tracking. The project consisted of implementing an Object Tracking UI in Pitivi and the associated tracking functionality in GStreamer.
cvtracker GStreamer element flatpak: add opencv_contrib
I began by adding the opencv_contrib module to the opencv installation for the Pitivi development environment. opencv_contrib contains the library with the tracking algorithms.</description>

      <description>My last post was about adding a feature to track objects. But sometimes the algorithm doesn&amp;rsquo;t track the object 100% correct, so in this post, I present to you a new update which lets the user edit the tracked data easily in the Pitivi Tracker Perspective itself.
Demo See the feature in action. YouTube
In the video, the user selects a clip and goes to the Tracker Perspective, by clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Track Object&amp;rdquo; button.</description>

      <description>I’ve been selected as a student developer at Pitivi for Google Summer of Code 2020. My project is to create an object tracking and blurring feature.
The tracking is done by passing the video clip through a pipeline which includes a tracker plugin. So, the first goal of the project was to implement the tracker plugin in GStreamer.
Introducing cvtracker This is a GStreamer plugin which allows the user to select an object in the initial frame of a clip by specifying the object’s bounding box (x, y, width and height coordinates).</description>

      <description>I’ve been selected as a student developer at Pitivi for Google Summer of Code 2020. My project is to create an object tracking and blurring feature.
In this post, I introduce a feature in development which allows the user to track an object inside a video clip.

In the video, the user selects the clip to be used and clicks on the “Track object” button.</description>
