      <description>My last post was about adding a feature to track objects. But sometimes the algorithm doesn&amp;rsquo;t track the object 100% correct, so in this post, I present to you a new update which lets the user edit the tracked data easily in the Pitivi Tracker Perspective itself.
Demo See the feature in action. YouTube
In the video, the user selects a clip and goes to the Tracker Perspective, by clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Track Object&amp;rdquo; button.</description>

      <description>I’ve been selected as a student developer at Pitivi for Google Summer of Code 2020. My project is to create an object tracking and blurring feature.
In this post, I introduce a feature in development which allows the user to track an object inside a video clip.
Object tracking in action Before diving into the aspects, let’s see it in action. YouTube
In the video, the user selects the clip to be used and clicks on the “Track object” button.</description>
